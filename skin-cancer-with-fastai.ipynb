If you've been through FastAI's course before this might seem firmiliar, if not take a look at some of the basics from week one. \n\nBecause this is a balenced dataset today I'm simply going look at accuracy as the evaluation metric. This project is for educational purposes and considering that I cobbled together with some spare time on my weekend, I'm pretty happy with this. I'm not a doctor (I don't even play one on TV).\n\nThanks to:\n* Cluadio Fanconi https://www.kaggle.com/fanconic for the Task, and also for creating a submission to compete against (His model produced an accuracy of about 92% so thats what I'm shoot for)\n* The International Skin Imaging Collaboration https://www.isic-archive.com/ for the dataset. All the images are well centered and are size 224 so they made the bar for entry very reasonable."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport sys\n%reload_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom fastai import *\nfrom fastai.vision import *","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"PATH = Path('/kaggle/input/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign/')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = ImageDataBunch.from_folder(PATH, train=\"train/\",\n#                                  valid=\"train/\",\n#                                  test=\"test/\",\n                                  valid_pct=.3,\n                                  ds_tfms=get_transforms(),\n                                  size=224,bs=32, \n                                  ).normalize(imagenet_stats)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f'Classes: \\n {data.classes}')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"learn = cnn_learner(data, models.resnet50, metrics=error_rate)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"learn.summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"learn.fit_one_cycle(4)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"interp = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn)\n\nlosses,idxs = interp.top_losses()\n\nlen(data.valid_ds)==len(losses)==len(idxs)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"interp.plot_confusion_matrix(figsize=(4,4))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Model_Path = Path('/kaggle/working/')\nlearn.model_dir = Model_Path\nlearn.save('stage-1')#checkpointing the model incase the next couple of tasks backfire","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"learn.unfreeze()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"learn.fit_one_cycle(2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"learn.lr_find()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"learn.recorder.plot()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"learn.fit_one_cycle(3, max_lr=slice(1e-6,1e-4))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"interp = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn)\nlosses,idxs = interp.top_losses()\nlen(data.valid_ds)==len(losses)==len(idxs)\ninterp.plot_confusion_matrix(figsize=(4,4))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Final thoughts:\nInitially this would appear to have an accuracy of 93%(at least on the validation set). Each week I challenge myself to complete one Kaggle Task and this week I didn't have enough time to do this project justice. While my results look good, I did not manage to test for overfitting (which is a serious asterisk to append to this). Later I will revisit this notebook when I'm able to retest the model against the test data instead of just a validation set.\n\nIf you have any constructive feedback feel free to message me or leave a comment. If you liked the notebook I'd appriciate the upvote. And if you would like to collaborate with me on a future Kaggle task send me a message here or on LinkedIn."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"learn.save('Final')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
